Hello, I'm olevy100 I'm a beginner coder, but I have created a few simple projects in Python including a simple dice roller, a name generator, and a Hunger Games simulator as well as a few more. I 
got into coding in September of 2023, and I've done some simple projects every few months since then. The projects I will make are meant to inspire your projects, help answer some of your questions 
about coding in Python, and be used in more complex coding projects. Happy Coding! As with most creative people, I have those who inspire me, for me that would the amazing people at W3 school, 
Geeks for Geeks, Stack Overflow, etc. I would not be where I am without them.

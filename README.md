Hello, I'm olevy100 I'm a beginner coder, but I have created a few simple projects in Python including a simple dice roller, a name generator/ "helper bot" (it can barely do anything),
and a contact list maker. I got into coding in September of 2023, and I've done some simple projects every few months since then. The projects I will make are meant to inspire your projects,
help answer some of your questions about coding in Python, and be used in more complex coding projects. Happy Coding!
